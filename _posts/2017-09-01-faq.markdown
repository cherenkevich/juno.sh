#### What is Kernels?
Kernels is an iPad client for Jupyter Notebook — it lets you connect to a remote Jupyter notebook server and do everything you do with Jupyter on desktop, anywhere.

#### When is it out?
[Public beta](/#mce-EMAIL){:target="_blank"} is now available with AppStore release coming this fall.

#### Is Kernels what Computable used to be?
Not really. [Computable](http://computableapp.com){:target="_blank"} was only capable of creating and running notebooks locally, whereas Kernels allows you to connect to a remote Jupyter notebook server in order to edit and run any notebooks you have there using server's computational resources.

#### Can it run notebooks locally?
No, you need a [notebook server](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/public_server.html){:target="_blank"} that will do the actual computing. There are many options of running a notebook server: it can be your own laptop in your local network, AWS node or even a dedicated powerful GPU-enabled machine configured as a public server, or accessible via VPN Tunneling.

#### I have a self-signed SSL certificate which doesn't work on iOS.
Check out our [step-by-step guide](/ssl-self-signed-cert){:target="_blank"} on how to configure certificates and enable SSL, so that you are able to connect to your server from iPad.

#### Can't I already do all that in Safari?
Kernels can do a lot on top of what Safari has to offer. It has responsive and less intrusive UI, benefits from full hardware keyboard support, supports iOS multitasking and has an extensive pipeline of other features coming prior to its release.

#### My hardware keyboard doesn’t have an Esc key.
Kernels has additional binding to **Control** key, which duplicates **Esc** key and lets you enter command mode, for instance.

#### We use Jupyter products in our organization.
If your workflow involves Jupyter notebooks and:
* You would like **Kernels** to have a deeper integration with your internal services.
* You want to fit **Kernels** into your organization's infrastructure.
* You require a higher level of support.

Please, send an inquiry to [contact@kernels.io](mailto:contact@kernels.io), and we will be happy to help.

#### I discovered a defect.
Please, report all defects and send feature requests to [feedback@kernels.io](mailto:feedback@kernels.io).

#### I can't get it to work!
Please, check out [Jupyter documentation](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/public_server.html){:target="_blank"} on running a notebook server, or send an e-mail to [help@kernels.io](mailto:help@kernels.io).
