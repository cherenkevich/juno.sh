#### What is Juno?
[Juno](https://itunes.apple.com/app/juno-jupyter-notebook-client/id1315744137){:target="_blank"} is an iPad client for Jupyter Notebook — it lets you connect to a remote Jupyter notebook server and do everything you do with Jupyter on desktop, anywhere.

#### Can it run notebooks locally?
No, you need a [notebook server](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/public_server.html){:target="_blank"} that will do the actual computing. There are many options of running a notebook server: it can be your own laptop in your local network, AWS node, or even a dedicated powerful GPU-enabled machine configured as a public server or accessible via tunneling. Alternatively, you could use one of cloud computing services that are based on Jupyter, such as [CoCalc](http://cocalc.com){:target="_blank"} or [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com){:target="_blank"}.

#### My notebooks won't connect!
Usually this means that your server uses a self-signed SSL certificate for HTTPS which doesn't work on iOS due to security restrictions — neither in Safari nor in Juno. Check out our [step-by-step guide](/ssl-self-signed-cert){:target="_blank"} on how to configure certificates and enable SSL, so that you are able to connect to your server from iPad.

#### Can't I already do all that in Safari?
Juno can do a lot on top of what Safari has to offer! For instance, it has responsive and less intrusive interface and benefits from full hardware keyboard support.

#### My hardware keyboard doesn’t have an Esc key.
Juno has additional binding to **Control** key, which duplicates **Esc** key and lets you enter command mode, for instance.

#### We use Jupyter products in our organization.
If your workflow involves Jupyter notebooks and:
* You would like **Juno** to have a deeper integration with your internal services.
* You want to fit **Juno** into your organization's infrastructure.
* You are a cloud computing services provider and would like **Juno** to support it as a backend.

Please, send an inquiry to [contact@juno.sh](mailto:contact@juno.sh), and we will be happy to help.

#### I discovered a defect.
Please, report all defects and send feature requests to [feedback@juno.sh](mailto:feedback@juno.sh).

#### I can't get it to work!
Please, check out [Jupyter documentation](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/public_server.html){:target="_blank"} on running a notebook server, or send an e-mail to [help@juno.sh](mailto:help@juno.sh).
