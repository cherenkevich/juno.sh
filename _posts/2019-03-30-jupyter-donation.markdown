I'm pleased to announce that from now on I will be donating **10%** of all Juno sales proceeds to Project Jupyter. 

Juno itself is not open-source, but I fully recognize the importance of open-source software. I think it's necessary to show support to projects which made Juno possible in the first place — such as Jupyter. I highly admire their work, and hope that this (small) contribution will nevertheless prove valuable to the Jupyter community!

If you would like to support Project Jupyter, consider [making a donation](https://numfocus.salsalabs.org/donate-to-jupyter/index.html){:target="_blank"}, too. If you like Juno and would like to support its development, consider leaving a positive [review on the AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1315744137){:target="_blank"}: this honestly means the world to me!
