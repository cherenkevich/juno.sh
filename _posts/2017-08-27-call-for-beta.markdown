We are thrilled and excited to enter public beta testing of **Kernels**! If you would like to participate, please [sign up here](/#mce-EMAIL){:target="_blank"} and don't forget to confirm your e-mail address. We will then send you instructions on how you can install **Kernels** build on your iPad.

Please, keep in mind that you will need a remote Jupyter Notebook server to use the app, as it doesn't allow running notebooks locally. If you have a self-signed SSL certificate which doesn't work in Safari on iOS, take a look at our [detailed instructions](/ssl-self-signed-cert){:target="_blank"} on how to configure certificates and enable SSL, so that you will be able to connect to your server from iPad. In case you still can't get it to work, please, check out [Jupyter documentation](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/public_server.html){:target="_blank"} on running a notebook server, or send an e-mail to [help@kernels.io](mailto:help@kernels.io).
